// NOTE:
// In general the background colors in a theme are either light or dark,
// but not both. This allows components to be freely mixed together.
// The class oj-contrast-marker is a marker class for an area with a
// contrasting background color. Using compound selectors some
// components know how to render themselves on a contrasting background.
// For example the navigationList will render itself differently
// when an ancestor has oj-contrast-marker on it.
//
// In the san francisco theme we are using a light background for most
// of the page but a dark background for the header/footer,
// therefore in addition to the sass we are using javascript to add
// the class oj-contrast-marker to the header/footer when
// the san francisco theme is enabled.
